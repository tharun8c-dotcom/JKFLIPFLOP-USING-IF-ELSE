**JK Flip-Flop**

JK flip-flop is the modified version of SR flip-flop. It operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. The circuit diagram of JK flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has two inputs J & K and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of JK flip-flop is similar to SR flip-flop. Here, we considered the inputs of SR flip-flop as S = J Qtt’ and R = KQtt in order to utilize the modified SR flip-flop for 4 combinations of inputs. The following table shows the state table of JK flip-flop.

Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, JK flip-flop can be used for one of these four functions such as Hold, Reset, Set & Complement of present state based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of JK flip-flop. Present Inputs Present State Next State

By using three variable K-Map, we can get the simplified expression for next state, Qt+1t+1. Three variable K-Map for next state, Qt+1t+1 is shown in the following figure.

The maximum possible groupings of adjacent ones are already shown in the figure. Therefore, the simplified expression for next state Qt+1t+1 is Q(t+1)=JQ(t)′+K′Q(t)Q(t+1)=JQ(t)′+K′Q(t)

**Procedure**

step-1 Go to quartus software.

step-2 set new environment.

step-3 Type the code to implement JK flipflop usingverilog and validating thei functionality using their functional tables. 

step-4 Run the program.

step-5 Give inputs in the waveform table.

step-6 Run the program.

/* write all the steps invloved */

**PROGRAM**
```

module jk_ff (j, k, clk, rst, q);
  input j, k, clk, rst;
  output reg q;
  always @(posedge clk or posedge rst) begin
    if (rst)
      q <= 0; // Reset the flip-flop
    else if (j == 0 && k == 0)
      q <= q; // No change
    else if (j == 0 && k == 1)
      q <= 0; // Reset
    else if (j == 1 && k == 0)
      q <= 1; // Set
    else if (j == 1 && k == 1)
      q <= ~q; // Toggle
  end
endmodule

(OR)
JK FLIPFLOP

module jkff(j,k,clk,q,qbar);
input j,k,clk;
output reg q,qbar;
initial 
begin
q=1'b0;
qbar=1'b1;
end 

always @(posedge clk)
begin 
q<=(j&~q)|(~k&q);
qbar<=~q;
end
endmodule
```
